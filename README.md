# Plotly-BellyButton-Biodeversity
### Overview of the project
As data professionals, we analyze data and draw conclusions from it. However, to effectively convey our findings and recommendations to our audience, we make use of data visualization.
In this project we used Plotly.js (i.e., A high-level, and graphing JavaScript library) to create an interactive data visualization for the web comprising bar, and bubble charts.
We also employed D3 (i.e., A JavaScript Data-Driven Document) to fetch external data such as json files, CSV files and web APIs. Thus, for this project, we used D3. json to access the data.

### Results

#### Horizontal Bar Chart
We created a horizontal bar chart to exhibit the ten top bacteria cultures that live on the belly button.

#### Bubble Chart
We made a bubble chart to show the bacteria cultures per sample.

#### Gauge Chart
We created a gauge chart to display the belly button washing frequency in a week.

#### Dashboard customization
We used bootstrap and jumbotron in HTML to customize the dashboard we created. For more information see the index.html file.
